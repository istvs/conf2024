The _21st International and 12th Asia-Pacific Regional Conference of the ISTVS_ welcomes original and previously unpublished research and review papers describing results of research which are relevant to the conference topics and to terrain-vehicle systems.

* Authors wishing to make a submission are requested to submit an abstract by **March 15**, 2024.
* Submission opens on **February 14**, 2024.
* Abstracts are requested to be under 1800 characters and must emphasize the objectives and results.
* Authors may choose between the following two types of submissions:\
  **full paper** and **abstract-only**.
* For either type of submission, authors can choose to do an **oral presentation** at the conference or submit a poster for the conference **poster session**.

**Abstract review** // All abstracts will be reviewed by the conference Scientific Committee.\
Abstract acceptance will be notified to the corresponding author by **March 31**, 2024.

**Full paper submissions** // After abstract acceptance, authors submitting a full paper must make their submission by **May 31**, 2024. Each full paper will be subject to peer review by reviewers selected by the conference Scientific Committee. Each paper will be either accepted, accepted with revisions or rejected; the decision will be notified by **June 30**, 2024.
