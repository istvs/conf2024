# Awards

As part of the ISTVS mission to advance the knowledge of terrain-vehicle systems in engineering practice and innovation, ISTVS has awarded exceptional work with an awards program that includes St. Christopher’s Lectures, Bekker-Reece-Radforth Awards, and Best Paper Awards.

## 2024 St. Christopher’s Lecture Honoree

Since 1966, ISTVS has honored distinguished workers in the field of terrain-vehicle interaction by offering them the opportunity to deliver the St. Christopher Lecture at an international ISTVS conference, held every three years. Named for the patron saint of travelers, this is the highest award offered by the society. The recipient need not be an ISTVS member. Selection and invitation of recipients is the responsibility of the conference organizing committee.
