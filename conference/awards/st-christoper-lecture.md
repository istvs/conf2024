# St Christoper Lecture

## St. Christopher’s Lecture

Since 1966, ISTVS has honored distinguished workers in the field of terrain-vehicle interaction by offering them the opportunity to deliver the St. Christopher Lecture at an international ISTVS conference, held every three years. Named for the patron saint of travelers, this is the highest award offered by the society. The recipient need not be an ISTVS member. Selection and invitation of recipients is the responsibility of the conference organizing committee.

#### _Roving the Moon — Steeper, Faster and Smarter_

Professor Kazuya Yoshida has been working on lunar and planetary robotics research since 1997. From the beginning, he demonstrated the terramechanics, specifically the wheel-soil traction mechanics, of wheeled rovers on soft and deformable terrain.&#x20;

He conducted a series of experiments and simulations, using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) to observe soil particle flow around the wheels and Discrete Element Method (DEM) to simulate soil particle interactions. These methods provided insights into how rovers could enhance their mobility, particularly on steep and challenging lunar slopes.&#x20;

By investigating soil compaction, shear forces, and slip ratios under various loads and conditions, Yoshida’s work has advanced traction models essential for navigating rugged extraterrestrial surfaces. More recent research focuses on two key aspects of lunar rover design: faster locomotion and smarter navigation. By increasing rover speed, Yoshida observed a more dynamic soil flow, which demands refined terramechanics models to maintain traveling performance on loose terrain.&#x20;

Additionally, he and his team have developed a vision-based AI system for smarter navigation in unstructured environments. This AI system interprets complex visual information to identify obstacles, optimize path selection, and enhance rover safety on unpredictable lunar surfaces.&#x20;

Together, these innovations in high-speed terramechanics and AI-powered navigation will shape the future of lunar exploration, equipping rovers to operate reliably and autonomously across extreme terrains.

#### ACHIEVEMENTS

In 2011, Professor Kazuya Yoshida established the International Center for Extreme Robotics Research at Tohoku University and became its Director. He also built an exploration robot for the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident that occurred in the same year. He specializes in space robotics, including the development of SPRITE-SAT, and was the technical director of the Google Lunar XPRIZE team “HAKUTO.” For Hayabusa2, he developed Minerva II2, a small robot to be dropped into Ryugyu.
