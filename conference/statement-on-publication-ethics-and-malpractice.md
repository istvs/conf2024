### E. Plagiarism <a href="#e.-plagiarism" id="e.-plagiarism"></a>

All articles submitted to the Conference must contain exclusively original research. Passing off another’s research as the author’s own, copying or paraphrasing substantial parts of another’s paper (without attribution), or claiming results from research conducted by others are all considered to be forms of plagiarism. Plagiarism in all its forms constitutes unethical publishing behavior and is unacceptable.

### F. Duplicate submission <a href="#f.-duplicate-submission" id="f.-duplicate-submission"></a>

Authors should not submit for consideration a manuscript that has already been published in another journal or conference. Submission of a manuscript concurrently to more than one journal or conference constitutes unethical publishing behavior and is unacceptable.

### G. Data fabrication and falsification <a href="#g.-data-fabrication-and-falsification" id="g.-data-fabrication-and-falsification"></a>

Authors should not include spurious data or false research results in the manuscript. Also, manipulation of the research process or the arbitrary alteration or omission of data which leads to the distortion of the contents or the results of the research should not be done.

### H. Citation manipulation <a href="#h.-citation-manipulation" id="h.-citation-manipulation"></a>

### J. Redundant publications <a href="#j.-redundant-publications" id="j.-redundant-publications"></a>

The artificial division of study outcomes into multiple articles for the sole purpose of increasing the quantity of publications constitutes redundant publication is unethical publishing behavior and is unacceptable. Multiple papers generated from the same study can be accepted if they focus on different aspects of the study, in a sensible and meaningful way.

### K. Rejection of manuscripts <a href="#k.-rejection-of-manuscripts" id="k.-rejection-of-manuscripts"></a>
