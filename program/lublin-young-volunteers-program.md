# Lublin Young Volunteers Program

New in this year’s ISTVS conference is the young volunteers program. Teenagers from Lublin high schools have the opportunity to participate in the organization of the conference by helping during the event. It is an opportunity to establish interpersonal contacts, generate interest in science and research — and especially terramechanics — and learn how to organize and perform a scientific conference. Interested young volunteers are asked to complete the online form below.

This initiative refers to Lublin - European Youth Capital 2023 program [https://lublin.eu/en/lublin/youth-lublin/about-eyc-2023/idea/](https://lublin.eu/en/lublin/youth-lublin/about-eyc-2023/idea/)

Additionally, it is required to attach a completed and signed consent form from parents/legal guardians:

Registered participants will be instructed on volunteering activities by the conference chair in the week preceding the conference.
