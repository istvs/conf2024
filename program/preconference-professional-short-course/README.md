# Preconference Professional Short Course

## Design and Dynamics of Off-Road Vehicles with Emphasis on Terramechanics

ISTVS invites a limited number of attendees to explore the design and dynamics of off-road vehicles with a special emphasis on terramechanics. Three speakers â€” remarkable researchers and educators â€” will deliver 90-minute lessons on crucial aspects of vehicle design, testing, and dynamics for innovative solutions in the field of off-road dynamics, safety, and comfort. The course content has a deep reference to both classical and upcoming innovations in terramechanics.

Number of attendees is limited.\
Available as an add-on to your conference registration or register separately for the course.

### Program

Welcome // 9.50 â€“ 10.00

**1 // Novel Methods in Analytical and Experimental Off-Road Vehicle Dynamics** | 10.00 â€“ 11.30\
Schalk Els, University of Pretoria, South Africa

The analysis and testing of off-road vehicle dynamics have changed significantly over the past decades due to new testing and modelling technologies. This lecture will summarize new developments in equipment for testing of large off-road tyres and tyre-terrain interaction, including wheel force transducers, static and dynamic test rigs as well as the use of cameras for measuring slip angle, rut depth and tyre deformation. The use of steering and pedal robots, as well as testing multiple vehicle interactions for collision avoidance system development will also be addressed. This includes testing in GPS denied environments such as underground mines.

**2 // Elements of Planetary Rover Design: Innovative Solutions for Optimal Traction on Extraterrestrial Bodies** | 11.45 â€“ 13.15\
Lutz Richter, SoftServe, Inc., Munich, Germany

This talk outlines key topics in sizing and design of mobility systems for rovers for the Moon and other planets, in particular from the point of view of terramechanics. The overall discipline of planetary surface robotics involves a mix of technology domains, being i) _mechatronics_ (electro-mechanical systems), ii) _soil-machine interaction_ (the science of terramechanics), and iii) _autonomy_, the latter due to the lack of broadband, real-time remote control of planetary robots from Earth.

**3 // New Trends in Off-Road Vehicle Design** | 13.30 â€“ 15.00\
Zbigniew Kiernicki, Lublin University of Technology, Poland

The design of off-road vehicles has changed significantly over the past decades due to new uses and fashions. New types of off-road vehicles have appeared. This lecture will present the development of off-road vehicle classification. The distinguishing features of different classes of off-road vehicles will be discussed. Examples of new design solutions for individual vehicle subassemblies will be presented, which illustrate the directions of development of off-road vehicle construction. Technical parameters of current off-road vehicles will be presented.
