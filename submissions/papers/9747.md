## Abstract
The rockie-bogie suspension arm is a topic fully studied for experimental rovers (Nildeep Patel, 2010), (Weihua Li, 2013). These types of suspensions allow vehicles to increase the stability and move across with multiple obstacles on the ground. It has been tested this suspension system for some academic studies for the agricultural research topics, but it doesnâ€™t have yet an industrial deployed application for agriculture sector. The agricultural sector is looking for solutions to increase the productivity without harming the environment and improve the health of soils. This global challenge must be faced with improved technological developments. For instance, the sugar cane industry at Colombia, South America has challenges to adopt new technological system to complain about. At the Cauca River Valley (24MTon/year sugar cane production), 75% of the fields to harvester and transport the sugar cane stalks is used with commercial harvesters and a system of trailers to move the sugar cane from the field to the mill factories. The main surface it has low slopes, otherwise. for the remain 25%, the industry faces with high slopes terrains, additionally with the lower capacity of the soil at the rainy and wet seasons. This condition increases the risk with commercial agricultural machinery (harvester, trailers and tractors). This work is inspired with the rockie-arm suspension, to propose a concept to transport sugar cane from the fields. A CAD Model has been developed to understand the kinematical and kinetics for the suspension and compared with other types of suspensions considered for this industry.  This work aims to explore new possibilities to adopt technologies developed from other industries to solve the agriculture challenges.
