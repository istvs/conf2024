## Abstract
This paper proposes a spatio-temporal analysis of sand-density distribution beneath a traveling wheel based on a particle image velocimetry (PIV) method. With the advancement of image processing technology and the higher resolution of commercially available digital cameras, the PIV methods have been widely used to directly visualize the sand flow field without tracer particles. They can output the numerous sand velocity vectors at a moment in time. By continuously connecting sand flow fields obtained, we can surmise their spatio-temporal changes, though, each flow field is obtained as a spatio-temporally independent feature. Thus, we attempt to propose a PIV-based spatio-temporal analysis accumulating the sand flow vectors, and thereby show a spatio-temporal change of the sand-density distributions beneath the traveling wheel, where the sand density is represented by the relative density. Although the method requires some assumptions, it can represent the spatio-temporal behavior of the sandy terrain, which has not been shown before.
