## Abstract
The vehicle dynamics of off-road vehicles tend to be non-linear concerning suspension dynamics, tyre-terrain interactions, and subsystem kinematics. These non-linearities limit the performance of control due to the need for linearization to enable real-time application. Implementing real-time non-linear controllers and prediction methods on embedded systems, such as the dSPACE MicroAutoBox 2 (MABX2), is challenging due it being computationally intensive. This challenge is particularly pronounced for controllers utilizing optimization schemes with non-linear solvers to solve optimal control problems. In this paper, we explore the possibility of embedding non-linear optimal controllers and predictors on a MABX2 for real-time applications. The implementation uses CasADi to formulate and code-generate the problems, and then executes this code using S-Functions in Simulink or off-loading the execution to a powerful external computer. We discuss the limitations and special considerations for these real-time implementations for off-road vehicle applications.
