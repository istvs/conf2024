Title: Improving predictive control methods on off-road vehicles with realistic steering preview inputs

Authors: Andries Peenze and Schalk Els

Abstract: This paper investigates improvements to predictive control methods for off-road vehicles with the addition of realistic steering preview. The objective of this study is to improve the performance and efficacy of predictive controllers by accounting for significant time delays in active and semi-active systems on vehicles. The zero-order and first-order hold methods for steer preview are compared to a more realistic steer preview obtained from the curvature of the path, vehicle velocity, and tyre lateral force properties. A new semi-active suspension system, rear wheel steering, and individual brake control are used as the actuators on this off-road vehicle. The results show that the addition of a realistic steering preview improves the handling performance of the vehicle in a severe manoeuvre without affecting normal driving on smooth and rough roads. The controller can pre-empt and consider the effect of the actuator time delays, and the preview states from the predictive controller are more representative over the prediction horizon. In conclusion, the findings suggest that the addition of a realistic steering preview improves the performance of a predictive controller on vehicles, and further investigation of other disturbances and their preview effects on the system should be conducted to find further improvements for predictive control strategies on vehicles.
