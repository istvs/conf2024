## Abstract
Wheeled rovers have been the primary choice for lunar exploration due to their speed and efficiency. However, deeper areas, such as lunar caves and craters, require the mobility of legged robots. To do so, appropriate end effectors must be designed to enable climbing and walking on the granular surface of the Moon. This paper investigates the behavior of an underactuated soft gripper on deformable granular material when a legged robot is walking in soft soil. A modular test bench and a simulation model were developed to observe the gripper sinkage behavior under load. The gripper uses tendon-driven fingers to match its target shape and grasp on the target surface using multiple micro-spines. The sinkage of the gripper in silica sand was measured by comparing the axial displacement of the gripper with the nominal load of the robot mass. Multiple experiments were performed to observe the sinkage of the gripper over a range of slope angles. A simulation model accounting for the degrees of compliance of the gripper fingers was created using Altair MotionSolve software and coupled to Altair EDEM to compute the gripper interaction with particles utilizing the discrete element method. After validation of the model, complementary simulations using Lunar gravity and a regolith particle model were performed. The results show that a satisfactory gripper model with accurate freedom of motion can be created in simulation using the Altair simulation packages and expected sinkage under load in a particle-filled environment can be estimated using this model. By computing the sinkage of the end effector of legged robots, the results can be directly integrated into the motion control algorithm and improve the accuracy of mobility in a granular material environment.
