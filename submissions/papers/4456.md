Title: Modeling soil-tool interaction of a cultivator sweep using DEM

Authors: Peeyush Soni, Sumit Parmar and Prakhar Patidar

Abstract: The discrete element method (DEM) is a powerful tool for predicting soil disturbance and cutting forces in soil cutting tools, aiding in design optimization. In this study, we calibrated DEM input parameters to model a sandy loam soil using the hysteretic spring contact model, linear cohesion model, and a nominal particle radius of 5 mm. The DEM simulations were validated using experimental lab results, considering the effects of speed and depth. Some soil properties were measured in the laboratory, while others were obtained from literature and used as input parameters in Altair EDEM. We constructed a 3-D model of the cultivator tyne, and by combining the implement design with soil parameters and implement parameters (depth of operation, various speeds), we performed simulations in Altair EDEM software. Prior to the soil bin test, essential sensors such as load cells and torque transducers were calibrated. Overall, the DEM results closely aligned with the experimental findings, demonstrating similar trends. Comparing the measured and predicted tillage forces under various conditions, we achieved correlation coefficients ranging from 0.8 to 0.85. This demonstrates a highly accurate prediction of tillage forces.
