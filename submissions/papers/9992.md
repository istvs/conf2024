Title: Soil shear strength values obtained from its colour

Authors: Alaa El Hariri and Peter Kiss

Abstract: The soil shear strength and its parameters are important values that reflect the resistance of the soil to shearing. The soil shear strength relates the shear cohesion, internal friction angle, and the applied consolidation pressure through the linear Coulomb model. The paper embeds shear strength, shear cohesion, and internal friction angle results of a sandy loam soil and a clay soil at different moisture contents. The shear strength values were obtained using the direct shear test, also by drawing the Mohr-Coulomb line. Beside the mentioned values, the article contains colour results of the tested soil types at different moisture contents, measured using the spectrophotometric technology in the visible band (spectrum; 400-700 nm). Relating the colour of the soil to its shear strength values through its moisture content, might be helpful in the field for identifying the shear strength and its parameters based on the colour of the soil, and this target is achieved by laboratory empirical work. The process of correlating the soil colour and its shear strength values at different moisture contents is presented in the paper. The measurements were carried out at the Hungarian University of Agriculture and Life Sciences (MATE - Department of Vehicle Technology Laboratory).
