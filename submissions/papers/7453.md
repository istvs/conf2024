## Abstract
The mobility of off-road vehicles, especially military vehicles, integrated rescue system vehicles and civilian vehicles in an open terrain where it is necessary to cross rivers, is dependent on the current hydrological conditions and technical parameters of the vehicles. In addition, we can also calculate the ability of drivers to maneuver the vehicle while crossing water courses. The article describes the methodology for determining the parameters of changes in the depth and speed of the water flow and also includes the results of testing the ability to wade through water bodies or overcome them by swimming amphibious vehicles. The mentioned classification of changes in the characteristics of water courses is important for a better understanding of the influence of watercourses on the mobility of vehicles in open terrain outside the road network.
