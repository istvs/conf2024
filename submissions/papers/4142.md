## Abstract
To improve the efficiency and optimization of compaction work using a vibratory roller to prevent water leakage in dry rice direct seeding fields, we investigated how the number of compaction passes affects soil physical properties (hardness and permeability), crop growth, and root system development. Cultivation tests showed that compaction operations effectively prevent leakage and increase the number of seedlings. We analyzed its effect on 3D X-ray CT image-confirmed vertical root elongation under all conditions. In addition, we qualitatively confirmed that the roots tended to become thinner when the number of compactions was 5 compared to other conditions. Additionally, WinRHIZO analysis revealed the following: the root dry weight per number of stems decreased with 1- and 3-pass compaction and increased with 5-pass compaction, compared to uncompacted soil. The total root length per the stems decreased after 1- and 3-pass compaction and increased after 5 passes of compaction. The composition of roots with a diameter of 0.38 mm, or more, increased after 1 and 3 compactions and decreased after 5 compactions. In addition, the composition of roots with a diameter of 0.28 mm or less increased after 5 passes of compaction. The above suggested that excessive compaction may have a negative effect on the root system of paddy rice (roots become thinner).
