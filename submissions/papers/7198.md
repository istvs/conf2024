Abstract: Flying from grass airfields is associated with the risk of surface unevenesses and their impact on safety and comfort during take-off and landing.This paper presents the measurement method and experimental results of a study investigating the effect of terrain obstacle geometry on the aircraft suspension system dynamics. Three different models of terrain obstacle geometry were tested: rectangular, triangular and semi-circular, each model having the dimensions of 300x150x50mm (length x width x height). Experiments were conducted using the GOM PONTOS measuring system, which made it possible to perform a dynamic analysis of the suspension system of a Cessna 152 airplane passing over the obstacles. Airfield experiments were conducted for three takeoff runs of 1200, 1800 and 2700 millimetres for each terrain obstacle model, respectively. The study investigated dynamic parameters of three crucial structural elements of the aircraft's suspension system: landing gear wheel, strut and its mounting points on the fuselage, for which accelerations and velocities were measured when the aircraft was passing over the obstacles. The paper includes details of the measurement method as well as the results and their analysis.
