Abstract: This study analyses experimental data of stress state under loads of running tracked vehicles in sandy soil measured with the SST (Stress State Transducer) in field experiments. Based on measured soil pressures, soil stresses in the orthogonal and octahedral planes were determined at the depth of 20 cm beneath the test vehicles’ right track. Three different tracked vehicles of masses—44.3, 12.13, and 9.7 Mg—were used in the experiment. Effects of road wheel loads distribution, driving velocity, and track slip on soil stress state were determined and analyzed. The field experiment were compared with analytical predictions based on Boussinesq theory as well as the Mean Maximum Pressure (MMP) and Nominal Ground Pressure (NGP) models. A model of an artificial neural network was developed, which allowed the detection of the moment when the road wheel of the tracked vehicle is above the stress state transducer (SST) sensor. It was concluded that the vehicle maneuver or drive mode (rolling, driving, velocity) affected soil stress state significantly. This is because of a varying wheel load vector during different drive modes. Finally, use of a flat value of wheel load in modelling and simulations of soil stress distribution may lead to erroneous results, without taking into account the wheel mode effect.
