## Abstract
Mobility on terrain is one of the key factors of off road vehicles. In conventional vehicle technology, an experienced driver can assess the obstacle negotiation capability of their vehicle, hence mobility models for manned vehicles usually have smaller resolution and are less detailed. However, unmanned vehicles can only rely on an algorithm both for global path planning and local vehicle control, thus such an algorithm for mobility mapping needs to be more detailed and have higher resolution than convnetional mobility models. In this paper, a method is shown to create a mobility map for a ClearPath A200 small scale test vehicle based on a drone-borne photogrammetry survey of the test area. The vehicle specific mobility model examines the vehicle-terrain interaction from the perspective of obstacle negotiation capability, while also taking into account the soil deformation and the stability of the vehicle. The vehicle-wheel deformations are characterized by a parallel element rheological model. Apart from the perspectives of off road mobility, the computational capacity requirement of the model is also examinded, which is a key factor for real time applications of unmanned vehicles. At the end, a method and test setup is proposed for the validation of the theoretical mobility model via field measuremets.
