## Abstract
Accurate modelling of the interaction between a tyre and the terrain is crucial for successful vehicle dynamics simulation, particularly in challenging off-road conditions. This study introduces a novel approach for obtaining highly accurate three-dimensional terrain models for vehicle simulation. Utilizing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a high-resolution camera, we developed three-dimensional terrain models of an undulating test track with two approaches. To validate the accuracy, these models were compared with measurements obtained from a traditional mechanical road profilometer. The results demonstrate a strong correlation between the two measurement approaches. The primary advantages of the UAV method lie in its speed of data acquisition without compromising accuracy and that the measurements are immune to the terrain macro roughness. In contrast to the labour-intensive measurements required by a mechanical road profilometer and extensive subsequent post-processing, the UAV approach requires minimal time and effort. Additionally, since the UAV method is not coupled to the terrain roughness, it eliminates the integration drift associated with other ground-based approaches which are subjected to terrain excitation. This opens the door to the possibility of modelling very rough terrains and using these terrain models for vehicle dynamics simulations in extreme off-road environments.
