## Abstract
Tyre models used in soft soil simulation analysis requires tyre parameters in the form of stiffness in multiple directions. These parameters are obtained from measurements on hard terrain as these parameters are a function of the tyre carcass construction. Vehicles used on soft terrain are also used on hard terrain. Many off-road vehicles used in construction, mining, agriculture and forestry use large tyres operating under heavy loads. Testing of large tyres is not a trivial or inexpensive exercise and outdoor testing has limitations on repeatability and load application. This is the case for testing on soft terrain/soil and hard terrain, thus it is preferred to conduct laboratory tests when characterizing tyres as higher loads can be applied and conditions can be controlled. This study investigates the lateral tyre characteristics measured during dynamic/rolling and static tyre tests. Tests are conducted on the actual concrete surface of interest, typically used in field tests with the use of a Dynamic Tyre Test Trailer. Static tests are conducted on the same tyre over representative surfaces in a laboratory with the use of the Static Tyre Test Rig. Multiple tyres are tested and measured tyre characteristics compared. The data can be used to parameterize tyre models of special, large off-road tyres.
