## Abstract
Mobility is solved in almost all areas of our lives. The importance of transportation of people and material is increasing every day. Mobility has many subareas, but the authors of this article focus on the mobility of wheeled vehicles in the terrain. Off-road mobility is necessary not only in crisis situations such as road damage, floods, but also in everyday life in agriculture, forestry and it is an essential part of the military sphere as well. In order to avoid getting stuck, it is important to be able to evaluate whether the given route is trafficable or not. Penetrometers are used for such evaluation; they measure the resistance of penetration to the ground - the bearing capacity of the soil. In the Czech army, a telescopic penetrometer is used for this evaluation. Based on many years of field measurements, this instrument measures reliably but it has unreliable evaluation system. Therefore, the authors decided to propose a new evaluation manual. To develop it, a comparison of existing evaluation methods was made. Next, the authors analysed the parameters influencing trafficability of wheeled vehicles and decided which ones to include in the procedure. Based on their previous research, they also decided to include a new driver parameter. New forms and evaluation tables were created. The whole manual was verified by the field measurements. The contribution of the work is the creation of a reliable manual for the evaluation of the trafficability for wheeled vehicles by the telescopic penetrometer, which is already established in the Army of Czech Republic.
