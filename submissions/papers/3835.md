Abstract: The mechanism of formation and the characteristics of the tyre lateral force play an important role in terms of driving dynamics, safety and comfort. In the case of an off-road vehicle, the generation of tyre lateral force is, among others, dependent on the soil. The effects of the three-phase nature of the soil medium may cause the characteristics of the lateral force build-up to be degressive or progressive. Experimental research was undertaken to determine tyre lateral force on the steered wheel of the Suzuki Vitara off-road vehicle driven on loess and sandy soil as well as on wet snow. The vehicle was equipped with rotating wheel dynamometers and a steering robot. The measurement of the lateral force was carried out for three values of the steer angle rate, δ: 100, 500 and 1500 deg/sec. Based on the obtained results, FY(δ) characteristics were obtained and further analyzed in order to determine the mathematical function describing the investigated mechanism of tyre – soil interaction.
