## Abstract
Biomimetic robots that adopt structure properties of desert animals have shown improved traversing abilities on granular soils over wheeled vehicles. To conveniently assess traversing abilities of these biomimetic robots, simulations for predicting robot behaviors on soil terrains can be used. Nonetheless, available simulation methods have not yet capable of predicting interactions of between robot foot and soil subjected to arbitrary motions. This work develops EDEM-Recurdyn-Simulink co-simulation method to simulate robot behaviors when traversing granular soil terrain. Using soil simulation parameters determined by experiment tests with a type of Mars soil analog, the traversing behaviors for robot to move forward and turn are simulated. Meanwhile, dynamic forces of robot foots are numerically estimated. The simulated robot behaviors and dynamics are in agreement with experimental tests. Therefore, this paper introduces an effective simulation method to assess traversing abilities of biomimetic robots on granular soil terrains.
