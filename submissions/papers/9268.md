Authors: Wang Yang, Zou Meng, and Li Jianqiao

Abstract: For researching the sinkage of the lunar rover on Earth, a soil bin test system under light-load conditions was developed, which was used for researching the soil-wheel interactions between the wire mesh wheel of rover and the lunar soil simulant. Results of the experiments of sinkage characters of wire mesh wheel under different slip ratio shown that: The sinkage increased with the increase of slip ratio, the height of rut decreased with the increase of slip ratio, while lunar soil simulant was under different prepared conditions; The sinkage and the height of rut both increased, when lunar soil simulant changed from compact to soft. Experiments of rut surface scan of wire mesh wheel shown that, the maximum sinkage of rut increased firstly and then decreased, the maximum negative sinkage of rut increased, the shearing action of terrain increased, the surface of rut was8 destroyed gradually, with the increase of slip ratio. The results provided basic experimental data for evaluating the sinkage of lunar rover and the physical and mechanical characteristics of lunar soil simulant through the rut of wire mesh wheel.
