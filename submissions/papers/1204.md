## Abstract
Soil cutting and throwing behavior during rotary tillage is useful to evaluate the mechanical design of the tillage blade. For this reason, several evaluation methods have been proposed in the past. In this study, a device to measure the angular velocity and acceleration of soil clods was fabricated in a laboratory test. The measured soil cutting and throwing behavior was compared with the behavior computed by the three-dimensional discrete element method (DEM), and the validity was also evaluated. As a result, it was found that the soil cutting and throwing behavior obtained by the inertial measurement device almost agreed with that obtained by the image analyses. Furthermore, the soil cutting motion by the rotary tillage blade differed between the measured results and the 3D DEM analysis results.
