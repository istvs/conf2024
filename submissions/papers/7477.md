Title: Evaluating the pressure performance of DPF filters using engine bench analysis

Authors: Norbert Biro and PÃ©ter Kiss

Abstract: Passenger and commercial transportation have a substantial impact on hazardous air pollution. The progress of exhaust gas aftertreatment technology is closely aligned with global emission regulations. The upcoming Euro 7 legislation in the European Union is anticipated to be more stringent in many aspects when compared to Euro 6, although its specific requirements are yet to be determined. Consequently, new DPF technology is necessary to comply with the regulation. This study aims to compare the pressure hysteresis of the current and proposed new generation DPF substrates. The objective is to draw conclusions and determine the compliance of the upcoming Euro 7 legislation in terms of pressure hysteresis.
